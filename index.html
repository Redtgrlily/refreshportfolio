                            </div>
                        <p>I've begun pursuing coding when I joined a company that offered a shopping platform for businesses that wished to launch their stores online. When the calls came in, most of the concerns were related to their front-end coding. Some had simpler demands and the more challenging requests required an advanced knowledge of troubleshooting within CSS and Javascript. After working with a team of employees that were also like-minded in pursuing coding, I've discovered that I wanted to pursue this as a career. </p>
                        <p>I tried to educate myself through free online resources such as Viking Code School, Codacademy, Team Treehouse and Udemy, I was invited to join another company with my troubleshooting skills. After joining the company I currently work for, I've discovered that my passion for learning programming had imploded. With my daily tasks of troubleshooting, I work with languages such as Javascript, Python and Node.js as a wonderful resource of practice. </p>
                        <p>Knowing that I've tried to self-educate programming, I found that my learning capabilities were best fit in a classroom environment. After hearing from my peers, my network and my friends that UT Coding Bootcamp was getting rave reviews, I decided to accept this challenge.</p>
